Here’s a complete step-by-step code example for downloading source and target videos from Dropbox to Google Colab, processing them for face swapping, and preparing them for use. This example assumes you want to run face detection and face extraction. For real-time face swapping, integration with virtual cameras would be more complex and might require local execution.

### **Step-by-Step Code**

#### **1. Install Necessary Libraries**

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed in your Colab environment:

```python
!pip install opencv-python-headless moviepy dlib face_recognition pyvirtualcam
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
!git clone https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab.git
```

#### **2. Import Libraries**

```python
import requests
import cv2
import face_recognition
import os
import dlib
from google.colab import drive
```

#### **3. Mount Google Drive (Optional)**

If you also want to access Google Drive for other files:

```python
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

#### **4. Download Videos from Dropbox**

Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual Dropbox shareable links:

```python
# Define Dropbox links and local file paths
source_video_url = 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/your_source_video_link/source.mp4?dl=1'
target_video_url = 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/your_target_video_link/target.mp4?dl=1'

source_video_path = '/content/source.mp4'
target_video_path = '/content/target.mp4'

# Download source video
response = requests.get(source_video_url)
with open(source_video_path, 'wb') as file:
    file.write(response.content)

# Download target video
response = requests.get(target_video_url)
with open(target_video_path, 'wb') as file:
    file.write(response.content)
```

#### **5. Extract Faces from Source Video**

```python
def extract_faces(video_path, output_dir):
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    frame_number = 0

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Detect faces
        face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(frame)
        for i, face_location in enumerate(face_locations):
            top, right, bottom, left = face_location
            face_image = frame[top:bottom, left:right]
            face_image_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f'frame_{frame_number}_face_{i}.jpg')
            cv2.imwrite(face_image_path, face_image)

        frame_number += 1

    cap.release()

# Extract faces from source video
extract_faces(source_video_path, '/content/source_faces')
```

#### **6. Extract Faces from Target Video**

```python
# Extract faces from target video
extract_faces(target_video_path, '/content/target_faces')
```

#### **7. Setup for Real-Time Face Swapping (Local Execution)**

Since Colab isn’t ideal for real-time processing and virtual camera setup, you’ll need to run this part locally. Here’s a local script example:

```python
import cv2
import dlib
import pyvirtualcam

# Initialize face detector
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()

# Load the source face image (assumed to be a single face for simplicity)
source_face_image = cv2.imread('/content/source_faces/frame_0_face_0.jpg')

# Initialize video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Initialize virtual camera
with pyvirtualcam.Camera(width=640, height=480, fps=30) as cam:
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Detect faces in the frame
        faces = detector(frame)
        for face in faces:
            top, right, bottom, left = (face.top(), face.right(), face.bottom(), face.left())
            face_width = right - left
            face_height = bottom - top

            # Resize source face to match target face
            resized_face = cv2.resize(source_face_image, (face_width, face_height))
            frame[top:bottom, left:right] = resized_face

        # Send the frame to the virtual camera
        cam.send(frame)
        cam.sleep_until_next_frame()

cap.release()
```

### **Conclusion**

1. **Colab**: Use the Colab code to download videos from Dropbox, extract faces, and save them.
2. **Local Execution**: Run the local script for real-time face swapping and virtual camera setup.

For actual real-time use in video calls, you’d need to run the local script and use virtual camera software to integrate with platforms like Google Meet.
